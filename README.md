# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using **vanilla JavaScript**.

It fetches and displays the current weather and a weekly forecast for a selected city using the Open-Meteo API.

Features include:
- Search for any city
- Display current temperature, wind speed, and wind direction
- Show a weekly weather forecast with icons

No frameworks or libraries were used â€” just plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
